/**
  This Jenkins script runs through accounts in Jenkins and highlights the
  permissions of each user.  This script can be run from a Jenkins job via
  "Execute system Groovy script" or the script console.

  This script is useful for identifying users who might have more access than
  they need (web search "principle of least privilege").  This can also help
  identify users who should be deleted.

  Notes:
  - This script only reads user privileges and does not do anything destructive
    (i.e. it will not delete users).
  - This audit list only contains users which exist in Jenkins.
  - Accounts from security realm groups will have a Jenkins user created only when
    they log in the first time.  Security realm users who have not logged in
    but would still get permissions are not counted here.
  - Jenkins automatically creates users from SCM authors in order to track
    their work across jobs and repositories.  Therefore, it's possible accounts
    will exist in Jenkins which are not available in the security realm.  These
    are not a concern.
  - Groovy bindings `out` and `build` are available in Jenkins jobs running via
    the "Execute system Groovy script" build step.  It serves as a reliable
    means of detecting whether or not this script is run from the script
    console or a job.
