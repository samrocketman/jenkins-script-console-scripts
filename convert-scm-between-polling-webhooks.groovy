   This script iterates through all Jenkins jobs and finds only jobs that have
   SCM polling or GitHub webhooks triggers configured.  In each project, it
   will do the following:

   - Stop and remove the old trigger.
   - Create a new trigger depending on whether webhooks or polling will be
     used.
   - Start the trigger.  If GitHubPushTrigger, then will also register hook
     with GitHub.

   Note: This script requires the GitHub plugin to be configured with GitHub
   API token which has the scope admin:hook on projects.
