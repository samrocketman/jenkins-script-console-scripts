   This script iterates through all Jenkins jobs and finds only jobs that have
   GHPRB triggers configured.  In each GHPRB configured job this script does
   the following:

   - Disables cron polling. (or enables it)
   - Enables managing webhooks for the repository. (or disables it)
   - Saves the job configuration.
   - Starts the trigger so webhooks are active in Jenkins and registered with
     the GitHub project via GitHub API.
